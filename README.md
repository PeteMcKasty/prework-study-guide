# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

The motivation in starting this project was to create a guide to help me collect notes on the topics that will be approached throughout this course. I built the project because it was the first stepping stone as I begin my journey and career in software development, and to immediately provide a tool to help me consolidate the information I learn. This project creates a one stop study guide for coding students and solves the issue of organizing class content and making it easily accessible. In building this project, I learned the basics of Git, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
